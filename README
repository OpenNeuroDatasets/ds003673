Participants: 27 subjects (26.52 ± 4.04 years old; 16/11 females/males; 25/2 right/left-handed)

Data acquisition:

Imaging data were acquired using a Siemens 3.0T MAGNETOM Prisma MRI scanner at the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center. Data consists of one anatomical image and two resting state fMRI data with simultaneous in-scanner pupillometry data acquired from each subject.

1. Imaging data

T1-weighted 3D anatomical images were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,400 ms, echo time (TE) = 1.22 ms, flip angle = 8°, slice thickness = 1 mm, in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm, 208 contiguous slices acquired in the sagittal plane). 

Functional T2*-weighted blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) images were acquired using a multiband gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence using the following parameters: TR = 1000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 55°, multiband acceleration factor = 5, slice thickness = 2 mm, in-plane resolution = 2 × 2 mm2, 75 contiguous slices acquired in the axial-oblique planes parallel to AC-PC line. Total duration of each functional run was 6:50 min (410 frames). 

2. Pupillometry data

Eye-tracking data were recorded using a MR-compatible infrared EyeLink 1000 Plus eye-tracking system (SR Research Ltd. Ottawa, ON, Canada). Minimally preprocess pupillometry data are available upon requests.
