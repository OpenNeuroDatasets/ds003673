Participants: 27 subjects (26.52 ± 4.04 years old; 16/11 females/males; 25/2 right/left-handed)

Data acquisition:

Imaging data were acquired using a Siemens 3.0T MAGNETOM Prisma MRI scanner at the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center. Data consists of one anatomical image and two resting state fMRI data with simultaneous in-scanner pupillometry data acquired from each subject.

1. Imaging data - Raw

T1-weighted 3D anatomical images were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2,400 ms, echo time (TE) = 1.22 ms, flip angle = 8°, slice thickness = 1 mm, in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm, 208 contiguous slices acquired in the sagittal plane). 

Functional T2*-weighted blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) images were acquired using a multiband gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence using the following parameters: TR = 1000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 55°, multiband acceleration factor = 5, slice thickness = 2 mm, in-plane resolution = 2 × 2 mm2, 75 contiguous slices acquired in the axial-oblique planes parallel to AC-PC line. Total duration of each functional run was 6:50 min (410 frames). We recommend to discard the first 10 s volumes in each resting state run to exclude frames when eye-tracking system was initialized and stabilized. 

2. Pupillometry data - minimally preprocessed

Eye-tracking data were recorded using a MR-compatible infrared EyeLink 1000 Plus eye-tracking system (SR Research Ltd. Ottawa, ON, Canada). 

Eye-tracking data were minimally preprocessed. Eye blinks were automatically identified by EyeLink tracker’s online parser. Blink-induced artifacts were corrected using 4-point spline interpolation. Blinks that occurred shortly after each other (< 100 ms) were combined and treated as a single blink. The signals were low-pass filtered using a first-order Butterworth filter at cut-off 0.5 Hz, after which the first 10,000 data points (i.e., 10 s) were removed to synch with the fMRI data. The time-course was down-sampled by averaging 1,000 consecutive frames for each 1 s bin, to match the fMRI sampling frequency (1 Hz). 

Minimally preprocess eye-tracking data (pupil area) are available in the ‘derivatives’ folder.
